            <h2>COSMOLOGY</h2>
                <p>Explore the Wonders of our Cosmos.
                    Our fantastic exhibition "The Sky Above Us", explores the night sky
                    and what we can see and know about the universe around us.
                </p>
                <p>We'll locate the various constellations and galaxies
                    that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators
                    that used the stars to travel by.
                </p>   
                <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration:
                    from early Arab traders, to Galileo's telescope,
                    to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

            <h2>EVOLUTION</h2>
            <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with thequestion of our origins.</p>
            <p>Where do we come from and how did we get here?</p>
            <p>Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution, we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                Discover the origins of life on this planet, and how the species we know today have evolved over time.
                You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didnt survive.
            <p>including our Wooly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too!</p>

            <h2>BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE</h2>
            <p>From micro-organisms to the human body,
                major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
                insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.</p>

            <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer
                and their quality of life much improved, thanks to
                the growth of our understanding of medicine.
                Over a series of exhibits, we explore the history of medicine
                and take a look at some of the major breakthroughs including
                the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.</p>
            <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries
                have come not only from the lab, but also from observing
                animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
