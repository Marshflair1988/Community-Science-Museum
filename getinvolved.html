            <h3>Volunteer</h3>
            <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep
                the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come
                and enjoy.
                <br><br>
                Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind
                the scenes of a working museum,<br> access to staff-only lectures,
                and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come
                together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies
                for the museum.
                <br>
                You can volunteer in a number of different spheres. 
                please contact us if you'd like to find out more about how
                you can get involved.
                <br><br>
                Get involved by sending us a message!
                </p>

            <h3>Internships</h3>
            <p>Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy
                the fun and excitement of sharing the wonders of nature
                with people?<br> Well you could be just the right person to
                enjoy an internship at the museum.
                You'll be learning from a number of different academics
                and people who are passionate about science and sharing
                it with the wider community.</p>
